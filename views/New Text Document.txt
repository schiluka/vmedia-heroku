 If any duplicate select item is entered, dont add it to drop down....display a message
2. Same for category as well
3. When I add new category, A new drop down with empty selects should be created. And the category name should be the label of that drop down. Currently it is going as a select option.
4. Clear modal input text values for each time.
5. For each drop down, the default selection should be "select"
6. When Apply Label, check if any of the select is selected. Otherwise display a message saying at least one label should be selected.
7. Above applies to Next button also....Only when the labels are applied, you should go to next video. Otherwise stay on the same video.
